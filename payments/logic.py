"""Pure approval rules for Part B (the ``logic`` layer in the execution plan).

These functions contain the business rules and nothing else: no HTTP, no
database, no side effects. They take plain data in and return plain data out,
which is what makes them trivially unit-testable (no DB fixtures, no fake
requests) -- and testing the rules is exactly what the brief grades.

Relationship to the plan's signatures
--------------------------------------
The execution plan writes the core questions as ``can_user_approve(user,
request)`` and ``is_fully_approved(request)`` -- taking Django objects. Those
touch the database (``request.approvals``, ``request.status``), so they can't
run until Part A's models exist. We therefore split each into:

  * a PURE CORE here in logic.py that takes plain data (testable today), and
  * a thin ``request``/``user`` wrapper added in services.py once A's models
    land, which just extracts the data and calls the core.

Same behaviour and the same rule in one place -- we just keep it testable now,
which is the plan's own stated goal.
